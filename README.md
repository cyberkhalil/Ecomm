## Ecommerce
This project showcases proficiency in web development using ASP.NET and the Visual Studio IDE.
It builds upon a modern graphical eCommerce blog website design, incorporating functionalities like product listings, a shopping cart system (depending on the project's scope), and most importantly, an admin panel for managing the website's content and functionalities. 
The project leverages jQuery and Bootstrap for a user-friendly and responsive interface.
